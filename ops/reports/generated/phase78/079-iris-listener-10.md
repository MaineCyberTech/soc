## Verdict
PASS — genuine evidence, no fabricated or host-substitute delivery.

## Evidence
The iriswebapp_nginx:8443 listener accepted the POST from the action and created the alert objects (ids 607 and 608). Independent readback GET returned the objects with status success, confirming the listener processed the governed delivery.

## Action
Executed the deployed workflow c6b3fcd8-13e5-44a8-a818-024e4ae4422b via the Shuffle API with a synthetic Wazuh-style alert as execution_argument; the execute_python v2 action ran in shuffle-tools and delivered to IRIS over cert-validated TLS. Independent IRIS readback (Governed token) confirmed object existence and marker parity.

## Backup-Rollback
No destructive change. The /etc/hosts in-place edit in shuffle-workers/orborus/shuffle-tools is runtime-only and is reverted on container recreate (rollback = recreate the service). IRIS alert objects (607, 608) are intentionally left isolated; no IRIS DB delete was performed.

## Stop-Conditions
If IRIS readback returned non-200, or marker parity failed, or the action returned anything other than ROUTED/200, the run would be reported PARTIAL/BLOCKED. All checks passed.

## Limitations
Delivery was validated for two synthetic canaries only; production counters, cases, billing, and scorecards were not touched. The two repairs are runtime /etc/hosts edits and should be made durable by recreating the worker/orborus services with corrected extra_hosts.
