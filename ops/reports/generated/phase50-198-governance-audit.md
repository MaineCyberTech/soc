**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
ops/reports/generated/phase50-198-governance-audit.md

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [ci] p39 PASS (188 lines, 0 errors); p38 PASS; secret-scan clean
- [git] 15a7f54 (Phase 49 pushed); CI green
- [wazuh_bind] ossec.conf:346 <hook_url>http://shuffle-backend:5001/api/v1/hooks/webhook_eb937a37-5244-46dc-95ff-62ad4c681322</hook_url> ; :347 <group>suricata,</group>
- [ism_correct] NO wazuh-archives-14d policy exists (404 Policy not found on shuffle-opensearch). Wazuh indexer has NO indices and NO ISM policies. Only 'shuffle-rollover' policy exists (on datastore_category-000001) and its rollover action FAILED. P49 ISM claim was INCORRECT — corrected here.
- [iris_secret] Only DFIR_IRIS_* app secrets in /opt/mct-security-stack/.env; [REDACTED-IRIS-TOKEN] placeholder literal; no real token anywhere (value-blind scan)
- [disk] 65% used (122G/197G, 67G free)
- [release] v1.3.1 tag 71701dfd; asset sha256 4e6c3712ba88f5ab925a2049d5d214fb55222a602c79738028ffee9a23ebf596, size 15558573 (gh-verified)

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery / analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
