**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
No signatures.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [autonomy] Safety: no secrets, no unapproved retry, no forced ISM deletion, no production routing, no field-limit increase, no weakened TLS, no destructive volume. Retry/apply/create gated.
- [trigger_status] stopped (and 'Hook ID not valid' on GET)
- [iris_secret] Only DFIR_IRIS_* app secrets in .env; [REDACTED-IRIS-TOKEN] placeholder; no real token (value-blind).
- [wazuh_bind] ossec.conf:346 <hook_url>http://shuffle-backend:5001/api/v1/hooks/webhook_eb937a37-5244-46dc-95ff-62ad4c681322</hook_url> ; :347 <group>suricata,</group> (Class-A CONFIRMED).
- [release] v1.3.1 tag 71701dfd; asset sha256 4e6c3712ba88f5ab925a2049d5d214fb55222a602c79738028ffee9a23ebf596 size 15558573 (gh-verified).

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery/analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow/hook/policy state documented; all gated changes reversible and unexecuted.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, unapproved retry, forced ISM deletion, production routing, field-limit increase, weakened TLS/exposure, destructive volume removal, fabricated PASS.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.

*Phase 51 — evidence-backed; secrets never exposed; no fabricated PASS.*
