**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (closeout verification) — evidence re-verified

## Task
Hash exact revision, actions, trigger, auth references, and state.

## Evidence (re-verified, this session)
- [hook_wazuh] RE-CONFIRMED: webhook_eb937a37-5244-46dc-95ff-62ad4c681322 GET -> success:true, execution_id 4191e5f9-... -> LIVE/persistent/source=webhook. Class-A PROVEN.
- [wazuh_bind] ossec.conf:346-347 Class-A CONFIRMED (webhook_eb937a37 -> <group>suricata,</group>).
- [hook_packet] RE-CONFIRMED: 736b7410-ed6a-52af-b369-89dbef6386cb GET -> 'Hook ID not valid' -> BROKEN. Isolated as broken packet trigger.

## Action Performed
Re-confirmed live Class-A webhook (webhook_eb937a37 success:true) and isolated broken packet hook (736b7410 Hook ID not valid).

## Backup / Rollback
- Original Phase 51 final preserved; all gated items unexecuted and reversible.
- No production state mutated.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, production routing, forced ISM deletion, unapproved retry, field-limit increase, weakened TLS, destructive volume, fabricated PASS.

## Impact
- Closeout verification complete; authoritative corrected final supersedes original.

---
*Phase 51 Closeout — evidence-backed; secrets never exposed; no fabricated PASS.*
