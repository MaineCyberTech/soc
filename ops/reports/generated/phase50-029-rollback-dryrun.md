**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Prove reversible workflow/config restoration.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [wf_id] e133a645-95b9-4e01-9454-e270d2a0b599
- [trigger_id] 736b7410-ed6a-52af-b369-89dbef6386cb
- [autonomy] Autonomy policy: read-only/non-destructive/test-only MAY_AUTO; trigger start/hook create/auth-object/Wazuh-apply/dashboard-activate/disk-threshold/restore require EXISTING_APPROVAL (none recorded) -> NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery / analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
