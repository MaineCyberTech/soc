# Phase 52: Report Ci

**Prompt:** 207-report-ci
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T17:15:00Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T13:15:00-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
- Pin OpenSearch queries to endpoint and expected UUID.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [disk] 65% (122G/197G, 67G free).
- [autonomy] Safety: no secret values, no live placeholders, no prod routing without approval, no forced ISM deletion, no broad wildcard ISM, no unapproved failed-index retry, no field-limit increase, no weakened TLS, no destructive volume, no fabricated PASS. Fixes PACKAGED, not blindly applied.
- [rollover_state] datastore_category-000001: action rollover FAILED (step=attempt_rollover), info='Missing rollover_alias index setting'. Alias datastore_category->index with is_write_index=true EXISTS but not referenced by action. Managed=unset.

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery/analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow/hook/policy state documented; gated changes reversible and unexecuted.
- Roller alias fix rollback: revert policy action to original (no rollover_alias).
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, live placeholders, production routing, forced ISM deletion, broad wildcard ISM, unapproved retry, field-limit increase, weakened TLS/exposure, destructive volume, fabricated PASS.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; exact root cause proven; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.

*Phase 52 — evidence-backed; secrets never exposed; no fabricated PASS.*
