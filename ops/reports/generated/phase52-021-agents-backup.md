**Prompt:** 021-agents-backup
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T17:15:00Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T13:15:00-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Hash/mode/time.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [ci] p39 PASS (188 lines,0 errors); p38 PASS; secret-scan clean.
- [git] 23f2242 (Phase 51 closeout pushed); CI green.

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery/analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow/hook/policy state documented; gated changes reversible and unexecuted.
- Roller alias fix rollback: revert policy action to original (no rollover_alias).
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, live placeholders, production routing, forced ISM deletion, broad wildcard ISM, unapproved retry, field-limit increase, weakened TLS/exposure, destructive volume, fabricated PASS.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; exact root cause proven; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.

---
*Phase 52 — evidence-backed; secrets never exposed; no fabricated PASS.*
