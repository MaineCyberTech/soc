# Phase 50: Rest Trigger Plan

**Prompt:** 045-rest-trigger-plan
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Design separate test-only REST trigger proof; never call it webhook proof.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [rest_exec] POST /api/v1/workflows/{id}/execute -> success:true, execution_id dda85ccb-fc86-463c-b5e2-b3784180d2eb (synthetic EVE JSON processed)
- [api_auth] Bearer header works; query ?api_key= fails ('Missing authentication')
- [trigger_status] stopped

## Action Performed
Executed workflow via native REST /execute endpoint with synthetic EVE JSON. Result: success:true, execution_id dda85ccb-... — proves execute_python logic runs (NOT webhook proof).

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
