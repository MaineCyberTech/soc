## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery/analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow/hook/policy state documented; all gated changes reversible and unexecuted.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, unapproved retry, forced ISM deletion, production routing, field-limit increase, weakened TLS/exposure, destructive volume removal, fabricated PASS.
