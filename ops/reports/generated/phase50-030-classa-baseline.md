**Prompt:** 030-classa-baseline
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Capture existing hook/workflow/delivery monitor and regression thresholds.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [wazuh_bind] ossec.conf:346 <hook_url>http://shuffle-backend:5001/api/v1/hooks/webhook_eb937a37-5244-46dc-95ff-62ad4c681322</hook_url> ; :347 <group>suricata,</group>

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery / analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
