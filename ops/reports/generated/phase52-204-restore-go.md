**Generated:** 2026-08-27T17:15:00Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T13:15:00-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** GATED — NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (or impossible without credentials/UI)

## Task
- Pin OpenSearch queries to endpoint and expected UUID.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [release] v1.3.1 tag 71701dfd; asset sha256 4e6c3712ba88f5ab925a2049d5d214fb55222a602c79738028ffee9a23ebf596 size 15558573 (gh MATCH).
- [git] 23f2242 (Phase 51 closeout pushed); CI green.

## Action Performed
STOPPED at gate. Exact blocker package produced below. No unsafe/credential/destructive action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow/hook/policy state documented; gated changes reversible and unexecuted.
- Roller alias fix rollback: revert policy action to original (no rollover_alias).
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- Secret disclosure, live placeholders, production routing, forced ISM deletion, broad wildcard ISM, unapproved retry, field-limit increase, weakened TLS/exposure, destructive volume, fabricated PASS.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; exact root cause proven; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.

## Blocker / Exact Package
- **Item:** restore-go
- **Reason:** Full restore rehearsal (NO-GO: no approved external target)
- **Decision:** NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (Phase 52 safety: never infer approval)
- **Required approver:** stack owner
- **Status:** STOPPED — awaiting owner sign-off

*Phase 52 — evidence-backed; secrets never exposed; no fabricated PASS.*
