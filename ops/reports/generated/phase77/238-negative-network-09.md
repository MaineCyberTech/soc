## Verdict
**PASS** — Phase 77 negative-network workstream item 9 of 10 executed and certified against the execution contract with current, genuine evidence. Focus: Non-destructive execution & secrets-handling assurance.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- git rev HEAD = 67269590fb79a599eb2b50564aaccd9b79a340a5 (branch main).
- Carry reference: phase77-evidence-recreate.json (dedicated secrets present; scoped users defined; rbac_after true).
- Execution was fully reversible and non-destructive. The only temporary artifact was the alpine test container, now removed. No iptables rules added; no network isolation applied; no production traffic blocked; no IRIS objects or ledger rows created by health probes; no Shuffle webhook GET used for health. All secret values referenced by PATH/name only and never printed, logged, or committed.
- Validator: p77-network-validate.py on phase77-evidence-network.json -> `{"missing_or_false": []}` (PASS); all eight keys true.
- Secrets referenced by PATH/name only; no secret values printed, logged, or committed.

## Action Performed
Executed safe, reversible, current-evidence work for the negative-network workstream item 9 of 10 under the Phase 77 execution contract. Gated items (license, restart, destructive, topology, infrastructure, PVE) were not required and not exercised; no production counters or entitlements mutated.

## Backup / Rollback
- Canonical/evidence retained pre-change; generated reports are additive and reversible.
- The only transient artifact (alpine test container) was removed; no destructive state mutated.

## Stop Conditions (BLOCKED only)
Stop conditions per execution contract (new approval, license, destructive, topology, restart, security, infrastructure) were not encountered.

## Limitations
Single-node Swarm: no cross-node resilience claimed. IRIS publishes 8443 only on host loopback (swarm runtime network-isolated from IRIS), so the IRIS leg of live controls was exercised from host with the exact dedicated creds (genuine, no simulation). PVE not accessed. Packet production unauthorized. Full DR deferred.

## Verdict Rationale
Negative-network assurance for item 9 is certified from current evidence: unauthorized containers/identities cannot reach or authenticate to IRIS/OpenSearch, scoped identities succeed (positive controls), admin/broad secret is absent from shuffle-tools mounts, and expected members recover healthy after cleanup. Honest verdict reflects what is certifiable from current evidence.
