**Prompt:** 204-scorecard
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Internal/client.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [ism_correct] NO wazuh-archives-14d policy exists (404 Policy not found on shuffle-opensearch). Wazuh indexer has NO indices and NO ISM policies. Only 'shuffle-rollover' policy exists (on datastore_category-000001) and its rollover action FAILED. P49 ISM claim was INCORRECT — corrected here.
- [autonomy] Autonomy policy: read-only/non-destructive/test-only MAY_AUTO; trigger start/hook create/auth-object/Wazuh-apply/dashboard-activate/disk-threshold/restore require EXISTING_APPROVAL (none recorded) -> NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED
- [git] 15a7f54 (Phase 49 pushed); CI green
- [release] v1.3.1 tag 71701dfd; asset sha256 4e6c3712ba88f5ab925a2049d5d214fb55222a602c79738028ffee9a23ebf596, size 15558573 (gh-verified)

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery / analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
