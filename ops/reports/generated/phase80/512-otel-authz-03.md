## Result
PASS.

## Evidence
This workstream is certified against the measured evidence in
`/opt/mct-security-stack/ops/reports/evidence/phase80/phase80-evidence-otel.json` (validator `p80-otel-validate.py` returns PASS: 18/18 required keys present and non-false).

## Summary
Authorization negative confirmed for the scoped `otel_collector` user (role otel_writer). Positive control: a write to the allowed index ss4o_traces-otel-mct-soc returned 201. Negative: a write to a foreign index returned 403 and an admin index delete returned 403. The scoped user is denied admin/foreign writes. authz_negative=true.

## Method (reversible, scoped, evidence retained)
- Backend outage was scoped to the collector's export path only (a hang blackhole on the OpenSearch
  export port); the shared OpenSearch service was never stopped and `docker compose down -v` was never used.
- The persistent (file_storage) queue, byte bounds, restart behaviour, storage-full bound, and corruption
  handling were exercised on the live collector and verified with `du`, Prometheus metrics, and direct
  OpenSearch document counts. Configuration changes were reverted to the production collector config
  (collector.yaml.prod, queue_size=5000, TLS to shuffle-opensearch:9200). Secrets were read locally for
  testing only and never committed.
- Validator command: `python3 ops/scripts/p80-otel-validate.py /opt/mct-security-stack/ops/reports/evidence/phase80/phase80-evidence-otel.json` -> {"missing_or_false": []} (exit 0).
