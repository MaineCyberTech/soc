# Phase 50: Owner Batch

**Prompt:** 175-owner-batch
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** PACKAGE PREPARED (owner approval required to execute)

## Task
Single ordered session package.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [autonomy] Autonomy policy: read-only/non-destructive/test-only MAY_AUTO; trigger start/hook create/auth-object/Wazuh-apply/dashboard-activate/disk-threshold/restore require EXISTING_APPROVAL (none recorded) -> NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED
- [trigger_status] stopped
- [iris_secret] Only DFIR_IRIS_* app secrets in /opt/mct-security-stack/.env; [REDACTED-IRIS-TOKEN] placeholder literal; no real token anywhere (value-blind scan)

## Action Performed
Designed and packaged the proposed change for owner approval. No execution performed.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
