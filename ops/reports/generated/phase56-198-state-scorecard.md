**Verdict:** DONE

## Summary
The workflow has no scorecard integration; synthetic events cannot impact production scorecards.

## Evidence
- EV-WF-SRC (VERIFIED): Live workflow source retrieved read-only via Shuffle API `GET /api/v1/workflows/e133a645-95b9-4e01-9454-e270d2a0b599`. Node `parse-eve-json` is `execute_python` (Shuffle Tools 1.2.0); full code inspected (no secret values read; token load is value-blind path-only).
- EV-TRIG (VERIFIED): `GET /api/v1/triggers` returns exactly ONE webhook `suricata-eve-in` (`736b7410-ed6a-52af-b369-89dbef6386cb`, status=running) bound to workflow e133a645-95b9-4e01-9454-e270d2a0b599. Class-A `eb937a37` (`wazuh-high-severity-to-iris`) is ABSENT from the live trigger list (matches Phase 55 drift). The webhook URL was NOT GET'd.
- EV-OS (UNVERIFIED): OpenSearch `127.0.0.1:9200` returns empty reply from host shell (ISM/capacity metrics unreadable) — Phase 55 monitoring gap carried forward; not re-litigated.
- EV-198-SC (VERIFIED, source): No scorecard/metrics/rating call exists in the workflow source. The only counters are `p53_packet_routed` (flag, see 193) and deadletter/notify stores; none feed a production scorecard. Synthetics are excluded from `p53_packet_routed` when clean (EV-194-ISO).

## Backup / Rollback
Read-only inspection only. No workflow, datastore, IRIS, Wazuh, or host mutation was performed. Rollback is N/A; any future workflow edit (dedup-fix 122 / ttl-write 139 / counter-increment 155) requires a pre-edit backup + sha256 into `ops/backups/agents/` and owner sign-off (gated).

## Stop conditions
None for inspection. Future scorecard feeds must exclude synthetic namespaces (overlay).

## Limitations
Scorecard system external; verification by absence of integration in source.

## Verdict rationale
No scorecard integration exists; synthetic isolation holds at workflow layer. Verdict DONE.
