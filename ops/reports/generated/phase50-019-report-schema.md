**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** EXECUTED (safe reversible) — evidence captured

## Task
Validate metadata/status enums/source paths and UTC/ET.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [time_utc] 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z
- [time_et] 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00

## Action Performed
Performed read-only discovery / analysis with live evidence; no unsafe action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.
