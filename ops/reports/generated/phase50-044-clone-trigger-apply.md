# Phase 50: Clone Trigger Apply

**Prompt:** 044-clone-trigger-apply
**Generated:** 2026-08-27T16:30:34Z (UTC) / 2026-08-27T12:30:34-04:00 (EDT)
**Timezone:** UTC authoritative; America/New_York (EDT -0400)
**Verdict:** GATED — NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED

## Task
Apply only if existing approval permits; never production-bind.

## Evidence (live, this session)
- [trigger_status] stopped
- [autonomy] Autonomy policy: read-only/non-destructive/test-only MAY_AUTO; trigger start/hook create/auth-object/Wazuh-apply/dashboard-activate/disk-threshold/restore require EXISTING_APPROVAL (none recorded) -> NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED
- [trigger_id] 736b7410-ed6a-52af-b369-89dbef6386cb

## Action Performed
STOPPED at gate. Exact blocker package produced below. No production/credential/destructive action taken.

## Backup / Rollback
- Workflow export available via Bearer-authed API; test-only changes are reversible.
- No production state mutated for gated items.

## Stop Conditions
- New approval, credential disclosure, production routing, destructive ISM/index action, disk-policy change, full restore, exposure change.

## Impact
- Safe reversible work completed; gated items isolated with exact blocker packages.

## Blocker / Exact Package
- **Item:** clone-trigger-apply
- **Reason:** Create test-only webhook trigger in Shuffle (no existing recorded approval)
- **Decision:** NEW_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (autonomy policy: never infer approval)
- **Required approver:** stack owner
- **Scope if approved:** reversible, test-only, evidence-backed; rollback documented
- **Status:** STOPPED — awaiting owner sign-off
